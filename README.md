## Description

Marking Assistant is a practical tool developed to streamline the process of marking assignments and writing feedback for students. It simplifies the process of creating, managing, and marking assignments. With this app, you can:
- Define assignment tasks with total marks and grading criteria.
- Easily mark tasks by selecting met criteria.
- Automatically calculate student marks and generate feedback.
- Temporarily store results during your session.
- Export results to an Excel file.

As a tutor, I designed Marking Assistant to address the challenges I faced in marking assignments efficiently. It is a handy tool that automates certain tedious processes while keeping the human touch intact.
